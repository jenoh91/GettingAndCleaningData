#Getting and Cleaning Data


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Unzips the file containing the train and test data sets and merges them all into one data set
2. Loads the activity and feature information
3. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
4. Creates a tidy data set
